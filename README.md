# JavaBankingApp

## A funtional banking application project to streamline financial operations using open-source java solution

## This project explores the power of simple beginner java techniques such as loops, object-oriented programming and simple librarys to create an efficiently tailored account management system. 
The sample code in this project demonstrates how to do the following:
*Create a new user account
*Deposit withdrawal system
*Financial operations such as interest calculation
*Manage account balances

## known issues(Work in progress)
At present, when at the last step (closing the app) the project gets stuck in a loop and reverts back to the selection made before that. This will be fixed soon!
